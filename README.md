Experiments on life

This is me playing around with some theories that are primarily philosophical. The idea is that life can only exist with death. Without death there is simply no impetus to do anything. This code was looking to "prove" that theory.

What I found was that traits that reproduced more quickly became dominant as long as there was death. Otherwise there didn't seem to be any drive to reproduce more. Anyway, it's still a work in progress that's incomplete in a big way!
